Started with FrameSet and iFrame.

FrameSet :

The <frameset> element was typically used as the root element in an HTML document, 
and it defined the structure and layout of the frames. It had attributes like rows, cols, 
and border to specify the dimensions and borders of the frames. The <frame> element was used
as a child of <frameset> to define each individual frame and its contents.

iFrame :

The <iframe> element allows you to display content from another website or a different part
of the same website within your web page. It's commonly used for embedding videos, maps, 
social media widgets, advertisements, or any other external content.
