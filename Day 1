Brush up about:

1-Internet : external work : Bandhwidth comes from wifi and the request/response goes through underwater submarin lines.
              internal work : every device has DNS which converts request to IP adress and similarly DNS convert Ip to normal text of Response.
              
2-IP v4/v6 : size of v4 is 32 bit(4 bytes) and size of v6 is 128 bit (16 bytes).
             we can generate 2^32 IP in v4 because of limitation of v4 we are slowley movin to v6 which can generate 2^128 IP's.
         
3-Cloud Storage : Cloud storage are servers physical computers. better services.


4- protocal : https ( hyper text tansfer protocol).
